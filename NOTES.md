Things I'm looking forward to learning:

    - The JVM paradigm - it's concepts and tooling etc...
    - A new language

Things I liked:

    - Compiling and compile errors for the win

Things that were easy:

    - Kafka Streams library although not "easy" I think it's going to be the easiest of all the things we need to figure out!

Things that were hard:

    - I felt like I was piecing little bits and snippets of information together, I think this just stems from not
        grasping the ecosystem yet.

How does the stack improve our current setup:

    - Working with Kafka "directly" will bring so many benefits. From an up to date API right through to an improved
        technology relationship with NGP (think shared tooling)

How does the stack worsen our current setup:

    - It will slow us down in the short term (I predict 2-4 months of implementation for that speed to start reducing quickly).

Confidence in the ability to work with and maintain:

    - Very confident as long as we're given the time learn

Speed of delivery:

    - Slow at first but in comparison to our current setup it's going to fly.
        The ease of transforming and storing data and getting all the benefits (resiliency of all data acrcoss the cluster)
